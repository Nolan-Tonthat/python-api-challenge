# python-api-challenge

## Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the !citipy Python library(https://pypi.org/project/citipy/), the OpenWeatherMap API(https://openweathermap.org/api), and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

For this part, you'll use the WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file. The starter code will guide you through the process of using your Python coding skills to develop a solution to address the required functionalities.

To get started, the code required to generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.
